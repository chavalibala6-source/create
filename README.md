# create
git push -u origin main

and Git stopped asking you for a GitHub username, but you pressed Ctrl+C (^C), so the push got cancelled. Thatâ€™s why nothing was uploaded yet.

This happens because youâ€™re using the HTTPS remote URL for your repo, so Git prompts you for credentials.

âœ… To fix it, you have two options:
Option 1: Use GitHub CLI / Personal Access Token (HTTPS way)

    Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic).

    Generate a token with repo scope.

    When Git asks for Username, enter your GitHub username.
    When it asks for Password, paste the token instead of your real password.

    Or save credentials permanently:

    git config --global credential.helper store

    (Next time you wonâ€™t need to enter again.)

Option 2: Switch to SSH (recommended)

    Generate an SSH key if you donâ€™t already have one:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

(Press Enter for defaults.)

Add your key to the SSH agent:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Copy the key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Paste it in GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys â†’ New SSH key.

Change your repo remote to SSH:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git

Now push:

    git push -u origin main

Can you run this and show me the output?

git remote -v
